* IButils -- Utility Functions for the IBrokers Package

** Installing the package

   The latest build of the package is always available from
   [[http://enricoschumann.net/R/packages/IButils/index.htm]].

   To install the package from within an R session, type:
#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval never :export code
install.packages("IButils", type = "source",
                 repos = c("http://enricoschumann.net/R", getOption("repos")))
#+END_SRC


** Example: The British Pound's Flash Crash

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports code :session *R* :eval query
  require("IButils")
  x <- ib_hist_data("GBP.USD", "CASH", "IDEALPRO", "USD",
                    directory = tempdir(),
                    whatToShow = "MIDPOINT",
                    barSize = "1 secs",
                    start = as.POSIXct("2016-10-7 00:00:00"),
                    end   = as.POSIXct("2016-10-7 02:00:00"),
                    accumulate = TRUE)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Plot it.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :session *R* :eval query :results graphics :file ./GBPUSD_crash.png :width 600 :height 450
  plot(.POSIXct(x$timestamp), x$close, type = "s",
       xlab = "", ylab = "USD per GBP")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:./GBPUSD_crash.png]]


** Finding the contract specification

To retrieve data of an instrument, you need four things:

- its local (native) symbol

- its type

- its currency

- its exchange

The easiest way to get these data is to first find the
contract in the TWS, and check the /Contract
Details/. For instance, for the call on the EURO STOXX
50 that expires on 16 June 2017, the /Contract Details/
look as follows:

[[file:TWS_Contract_Detail.png]]

There you have it: Symbol (=C OESX DEC 17  3600=),
Security Type (=OPT=), its Currency (=EUR=) and its
Exchange (=DTB=).

(It may even be a good idea to copy the symbol from
there: there may be several spaces within a symbol
string, which would be easy to miss otherwise.)


** News, feedback and discussion

   Please send bug reports or suggestions directly to the
   package maintainer, for instance by using =bug.report=.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :eval never :export code
  require("utils")
  bug.report("[IButils] Unexpected behaviour in function XXX", 
             maintainer("IButils"), package = "IButils")
#+END_SRC
